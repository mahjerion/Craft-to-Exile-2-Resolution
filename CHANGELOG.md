## [Unreleased]

### Updates
- Meet Your Fight adds 3 new bosses. These can be summoned via their summon items. Currently, Swampjaw is a level 10 boss, Bellringer is a level 20 boss, and Dame Fortuna is a level 35 boss.
- Disabled some Meet Your Fight items.
- Changed default world type to Biomes O' Plenty.
- Exploding towers no longer explode.

- Toolbelt recipes have been changed to also use M&S components.
- Simple Magnets recipes have been changed to also use M&S components.

- Set default Xaero's Minimap setting to lock north position.
- Moved the Areas notifications down a bit and got rid of the periods.
- Waystone Sharestones now have a custom recipe.
- Simple Storage Network blocks require Create products now. The idea is that Storage Drawers and Storage Overhauled can be used early on as storage solutions, and by investing some time into Create (first level of technology), you get access to Simple Storage Networks.

- Added 3 new runewords: Enigma, Rhyme, Call to Arms.
- Added 4 new uniques: Karui Ward, Skin of the Vipermagi, Shaftstop, Manald Heal.
