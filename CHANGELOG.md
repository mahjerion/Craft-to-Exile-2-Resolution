## [0.2.2b] - 2021-12-08

### Known Issues
- Placing an ornament on a Christmas tree on a server causes client crashes. Don't do this for now.

### Updates
- You no longer do the full amount of Vanilla damage. Most damage comes from Mine and Slash sources again (similar to Dissonance). This could be a pretty hefty nerf to melee early game (which I understand is struggling a bit already). Changes below should help melee early game. This also means that damage enchantments such as Sharpness, Bane of Arthropods, etc. are much less effective (but they still work a bit).
- Increased physical damage values of weapons.
- Increased starting energy and energy regen values drastically.
- Increased the time for completion for Divine Missions.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash, Infinite Dungeons, Performant.

- Xaero's Update Alert: if you choose to not reset your world for whatever reason, back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Instanced dungeons are finally here! Infinite Dungeons, from the author of Mine and Slash introduces instanced dungeons, similar to maps. Explore and conquer these dungeons for fantastic loot! Find keys from hostile mobs and use them to enter a dungeon. Before entering, choose the difficulty of the dungeon - defeat the mobs quickly to gain better rewards and dungeon-specific currency to be used at the end of the dungeon!
- Infinite Dungeons rewards include Mine and Slash items.
- Introducing Mercenaries - find Mercenary Leaders in villages and hire your very own mercenary for emeralds/diamonds. Equip your mercenary with gear to power them up. Make sure to continue paying them, or they may leave you! (Still in early stages, may be tweaked or removed)
- Increased power of common quality items. Also slightly adjusted max upgrades, dust per salvage, etc. across the board.
- Readjusted weapon damage and gave each weapon type a new implicit stat to distinguish them from each other. Eg. staves give more spell damage, scepters give heal power, etc.
- Reduced the spell damage penalty of the shield.

- Opening Chests provide 25 Favor instead of 20.
- Added more objectives and rewards to Bountiful to incorporate some of the other mods - especially Mine and Slash.

- Mine and Slash Profession level stat bonuses have been changed. Instead of all Professions provided bonuses to health/mana every 10 levels, they have all been diversified. Weapon Crafting provides bonuses to energy/attack speed, Armor Crafting provides bonuses to health regen/armor, Cooking provides bonuses to health/increased food buff effect, Alchemy provides bonuses to mana/increased healing, Inscribing provides bonuses to energy regen/cdr, Jewelry Crafting provides bonuses to mana regen/magic_find.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-12-01

### Updates
- You will need to reset your world for this update (but not necessarily your characters).
- Xaero's Update Alert: if you choose to not reset your world for whatever reason, back up your Xaero's Waypoints and WorldMap folders!
- Merry Holidays! I've added Christmas Spirit - a mod that adds Christmas themed blocks to the pack. For players on the official server, receive a little gift everyday (can be enabled on your own worlds, too - just follow quest line to learn how)! The gifts will ramp up in rarity as you get closer towards the end of the month.
- Minecolonies now must be in the Overworld again. We're going back to the original Overworld + Overworld Mirror combo.
- Claims have been changed. You now use FLAN for claims rather than FTB Chunks. Type /flan to view the commands. At present, you start with 512 claim blocks. Claims must be at least 64 blocks. Every few seconds you play, you'll earn 1 block, up to a maximum of ~10000 blocks. After 30 days of inactivity, if your claim is under a certain size (around 2000 blocks), it will be deleted.
- Sophisticated Backpacks has replaced Useful Backpacks. These backpacks can be upgraded and use components from other parts of the pack.
- Spawners are now indestructible. They SHOULD go on a 15 minute cooldown after being active for 5 minutes (please let me know if this doesn't work).
- Disabled Botania's Life Aggregator (Spawner Mover).
- Increased spawn rate of some dungeons.
- Foliaath's no longer give a lot of EXP.
- Mobs at lower levels do more damage again.
- Enchantment max levels have been toned down drastically to either their vanilla values, or below (for modded enchants).
- Disabled Life Mending, Occult Aversion enchants.
- Equipment durability is higher the higher rarity it is.
- I removed FTB mods in favour of more modular and configurable mods (ThutPerms/FLAN). The problem with Ranks/Chunks is that they were unable to be configured for shipment with modpacks.
- Team command should be enabled by default now when playing on servers.
- Witches can now spawn in the Exile towers.
- With the addition of Temporary Spawners, Anti Mob Farm penalties have been reduced immensely. They still exist, but not even close to what it used to be before.

- Added a quest explaining Identification in Mine and Slash.
- Added quests explaining Divine Missions.
- Added quests explaining the upgrade system.
- Chests should now contain some loot from Mine and Slash. Village chest also contain loot from Mine and Slash, but it's not as good.
- Favor is currently still disabled as Lootr chests are not working with the system. The change below is for later when it's fixed and I can reenable Favor.
- Favor has reconfigured so that you no longer receive any "penalties" for having no favor, only bonuses at higher favor counts.
- You now start the game with a quest book as well. The hotkey still exists, but this will be helpful for new players who don't know there's a hotkey.
- Improved the animations of Epic Fight mod, thanks to asanginxst for the awesome resource pack!
- You no longer can see the Favor and Difficulty Scaling GUI in the Mine and Slash hub. This will hold true for as long as they're disabled.

## [0.1.2] - 2021-11-08

### Updates
- Added some more quests up until Act II.
- Energy cost of weapons has been reduced by 25-33%.
- Changed item rarity glint to border instead of full to be less intrusive.
- Made the question mark on stat souls more transparent to be less intrusive.
- Disabled auto third-person camera upon entering battle mode.
- Disabled the Flight Tiara from Botania.
- Disabled Experience Orb clustering from Adaptive Performance Tweaks - we get it from Clumps now.
- Spawners are now super tough to discourage breaking them. I don't want to make them unbreakable however.
- Bumped up Pandora's Creatures mob spawns again since I fixed the crazy spawns.
- FTB Islands initial claim size is smaller now.
- You now get sent to the Void Dimension for FTB Islands.
- Colonies can now be made in any dimension (but you should really stick to the Void Dimension).
- You can now see the GUI of other players.
- Performance near tile entities should be improved.
- Reduced difficulty of mobs at higher levels.
- Mobs now do much less damage than previously, 75% less at level 1, 25% less at level 100. Please let me know how this change feels!
- Increased item drop rates from Mine and Slash by about 30-50%.
- Disabled Immersive Engineering copper ore generation.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Waystones, AmbientSounds 4, Repurposed Structures, Minecolonies, Performant, Drippy Loading Screen, Polymorph, Mine and Slash, FTB Chunks, JEI.
- Added Dynamic View.
- Added Out of Sight.
- Added Public Gui Announcement.
- Added Clumps.

### Fixes
- Disabled Meerkats for now as they're causing crashes.
- Fixed the crazy spawn rates of mobs.
- Fixed rarity glints being the wrong colour.
- Item tiers being incorrect while salvaging has been fixed.
- Archers/arrow spells should be fixed server-side.
- Epic Fight skills should be disabled properly now.
- Added a temporary fix for favor somehow being enabled. I've set it so the favor "rewards" are just consistent from 0-5000. Means that players struggling to level at 10 or so should no longer have that issue. Also items will drop at a normal rate too. This was compounded by the fact that Lootr chests seem to not provide favor also, so players would quickly run out of favor early on and have no way to regain it.
- Fixed tiers not being in the correct level range.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-11-04

### Updates
- NOTE: you will need to make a new world (probably).
